# **AI for Improving Efficiency in Patient-care**

## *Introduction*
<p> AI is being utilized for increasing efficiency in time management and helping provide quality interaction between physician and patient, during the point of contact. </p>
* <p> The company of interest for my AI case study is Augmedix. 
* <p> The compamy was incorporated in 2012, by t*wo Stanford graduates. It is based in San Francisco, USA, and they have additional offices in Bangladesh, India. They have plans to expand into Sri Lanka and Dominican Republic in the future. </p>
* <p> The founders of Augmedix are Ian Kazi Shakil and Pelu Tran. 
* <p> The idea for the start-up came about after Shakil graduated in Biomedical Engineering from Duke, and moved to San Francisco. He started woring in healthcare, for Edwards Life Sciences; and their customers were cardiology practices. While working there for the cardiology groups; he observed the struggles that physician had while dealing with EMR's and documentation after patient encounters. That observation influenced the commencement of their journey. The other founder Pelu, dropped out of medical school to partner with Shakil, to form the start-up Augmedix. They initially called it "glass business" because they were using google glasses then. </p> 
*<p> When they started, they had only around 10 to 20 employees in the initial 2 years. The google glasses that were being used, basically enabled the physician while interacting with their patiens to dictate through them. This dictation was transmitted to a recording device. This recording would be then get scribed by scribers. Then, this would appear into script format and ultimately be made available on the patient's EMR for the EHR programs such as Epic of Cerner and become permanent records of the patient's chart. </p>

## *Business Activities of Augmedix* <br>
* <p> Augmedix tapped into the issue that is playing out in every busy ER in a hospital. The issue of the high volume and inflow of patients needing to be evaluated, treated and triaged. The physicians have limited time between multiple patient interactions, making a diagnosis based on history provided by the patient or family, at the point of contact, then providing clinical care and documentation onto the EHR of the patient's chart. If the patient is brand new to the healthsystem, then documenting all this information before triaging the patient or discharging with limited treatment is vital. So, Augmedix is being used in the documentation part of patient care. According to the company's website "it can save the physician valuable time that can be dedicated to acutal clinical care". </p>
* <p> According to Augmedix, "some of the biggest challenges faced in the ED include 57% difficulty capturing all details during patient interaction*, 22% time wasted dictating notes after a long shift, and 22% keeping tract of unfinished notes between shifts. Hence, timely and accurate medical documentation is vital for informed diagnoses, treatment plans and clinical care; since, EMR are permanent records for the patient in every encounter within the healthsystem for use by various providers". </p> <br> 

### *Clientele and Reason* <br>
<p> The intended customer base for Augmedix is the clinician. </p>
<p> "Why Augmedix?" <br>
"Augmedix puts the clinician-patient relationship front and center by delivering industry-leading, ambient medical documentation products to healthcare systems, physician practices and hospitals". Their website, exhibits the following: 
> - "3 Hours/day Save Up To 3 Hours Per Day
> - 20% Increase in Productivity
> - 40% Improvement in Work-Life Satisfaction
> - 35% Increase in Patient Satisfaction" <br>

## *Funding* <br>
* <p> The details of the investment or funding are available on google. 
* <p> "Augmedix has 24 investors including HCA Healthcare and Redmile Group".  
* <p> "Augmedix closed its last funding round on Nov 15, 2023, from a Post-IPO Equity round". 
* <p> To assess the market size of the company: "According to the Department of Labor, there are 215,500 medical records and health information technicians, 58,000 medical transcriptionists, and 686,600 medical assistants employed in the United States, including medical scribes". </p>
* <p> Augmedix has a market cap or net worth of $138.91 million. "(Nasdaq: AUGX) provides automated medical documentation and data services to large healthcare systems and physician practices, supporting medical offices, clinics, hospitals, emergency departments and telemedicine nationwide". </p>
* <p> To discuss the hiearchy of Augmedix in comparison to some of the other companies: In my opinion, this company offers off-shore scribes that comes with cost savings for them. Some of the dictation software being used in the healthsystem such as dragon does not have the advantage of scribe and the user/clinician has to proof read the document and make corrections, which is again tedious and time consuming. Some, other compaines do not have the advantage of sending their dictations off-shore and therefore end up bearing the high-cost of scribes within the States. </p>

### *Competitors* 
* Augmedix competition may include Iora Health, Alignment Health, and FluidAI Medical. 
* Some of the top rated medical scribe companies include: 
> - "CityMD. 3.2. 643 reviews. 
> - iScribes. 3.7. 28 reviews. 
> - Physassist. 3.5. 42 reviews. 
> - Medical Scribe. 3.8. 131 reviews. 
> - Emergency Care Consultants. 3.4. 19 reviews".

### *Innovations/trends in the last 10 years* <br>
* <p> The source was linkedin. "The current company size includes 501-1,000 employees with 621 associate members". </p> 
* <p> Augmedix is now serving atleast 35 acute and ambulatory specialties amongst 50 EHR systems. </p>
* <p> Fast-forward to present from the google glasses, they are using other, more portable and convenient devices with speech-to-text for the same purpose. </p>
* <p> Their recent media announcement has been to launch a Chart prep. This supposedly would prepare a patient note structure with content for the clinician with data gathered from the specific encounter and previous medical records. This would make the clinician's task less tedious, as they would review up-to-date information such as labs, imaging, changes in medical history over time and any new diagnoses; all at the same chart encounter, just at the click of a button. </p>

### *Recommendations* <br>
<p>I think, there are going to be issues with AI advancements when it comes to dealing with people's emotional well-being, because there is a human at the other end of the spectrum with lots of feelings and emotions. The problems that could arise would not be limited to the bias in the clinician's practice. There can be lack of the human touch and empathy in this fast-paced encounter, privacy concerns and regulatory hold-ups with HIPPA concerns. With all this technology, the hope is that the clinican can still think outside the box and make the correct diagnosis and use the correct treatment plans. Between dictating and scribing and scripting, if a glitch occurs, god forbid, the wrong information does not get tagged on the wrong patient's chart. These are some of my thoughts on the reliance on technology. Some of the blogs also have similar thoughts: "The advancements that followers of Augmedix want to see as the next AI regulations continue to evolve include 50% hope to see data integrity, 20% want transparency measures, 15% are interested in an enhanced audit trail, and 15% want to see user activity monitoring".</p>
